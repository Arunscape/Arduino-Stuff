# Arduino-Stuff
A collection of Arduino projects I have worked on at the University of Alberta

## File structure:

### 2017 Assignments
* [Assignment 1 Chat Program](/2017 assignments/Assignment 1 chat program)
  This was the first major Arduino assignment, which allows for serial communication between 2 Arduino Megas
  Communication is done through the serial monitor, and the chat is encrypted using a Diffie-Hellman key-exchange and
  XOR encryption
  
* [Assignment 2 Restaurant Finder]()
  Using the Arduino, a Display, and a joystick we made an app that lets you search for restaurants in a map of Edmonton
  Restaurants are sorted by distance, and you can choose the minimum rating to display
 
 * [Final Project](https://github.com/bojotamara/arduino-chess-game)
  A 2-player chess game for the Arduino, complete with some lesser-known special moves like the En Passant!
  Exists in an external repo [here](https://github.com/bojotamara/arduino-chess-game)
 
 #### Weekly Exercises
 
 * [IPV4 Octets]()
  This program accepts input for a 32 bit unsigned integer that represents an ip
  address in decimal form. The program will then print the value of each octet in
  the ip address you entered.
  
  * [Stack]()
    An implementation of the Stack Abstract Data Type (ADT) in C++ using linked lists
