Stack using linked lists
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Usage: Any program can make use of the stack implementation by having an
#include "stack.exercise8.h"
at the top of the program. Then, the available methods to use are:

~Stack()  : empties the stack
isEmpty() : returns boolean 1 if the stack is empty
top()     : returns the data stored in the top of the stack
pop()     : deletes item from top of the stack
push(item): allows you to push an integer onto the top of the stack

This Stack ADT (Abstract Data Type) uses linked lists to manage the stack
implementation. Before, with the array implementation of the stack, memory
use was inefficient since, a new array twice the size of the previous array
was created and items copied over whenever a push was done. With the linked
list, the data structure grows as more data is added in a much more sensible way
