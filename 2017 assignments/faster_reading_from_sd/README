the bulk of code was developed in class. The getRestaurantFast() function was added
and a few minor modifications were made. The modifications are highlighted with
NOTE in the comments where I explain the tweaks. Some original bits have just
been completely commented out because they printed unwanted messages to the
serial monitor

Purpose:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This exercise guided us to think of a more efficient way to read a list of
restaurants from the SD card of the Arduino. In the previous implementation,
the function getRestaurant() would read the same block multiple times if the
reastauraunts requested were in the same block. Now, in the new implementation,
getRestaurantFast() if the restaurant requested is already in the block that is
loaded into memory, the Arduino won't unnessecirily read that block from the SD
card again

Accessories:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-1 x Arduino Mega Board
-1 x Adafruit ILI9341 display
-1 x 8GB SD microSD card


Wiring Instructions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Insert a properly formatted SD card with the correct files in the display board
connected to the Arduino. Wiring instructions for the display are below:


Display               Arduino
------------------------------------
GND        <-->       GND
Vin        <-->       5V
3Vo        <-->       NOT CONNECTED
CLK        <-->       52
MISO       <-->       50
MOSI       <-->       51
CS         <-->       10
D/C        <-->       9
RST        <-->       NOT CONNECTED
Lite       <-->       NOT CONNECTED
Y+         <-->       A2 (analog pin)
X+         <-->       4  (digital pin)
Y-         <-->       5  (digital pin)
X-         <-->       A3 (analog pin)
IM0 - IM3  <-->       NOT CONNECTED (they expect a 3.3v signal, DON'T CONNECT!)
CCS        <-->       6
CD         <-->       NOT CONNECTED


Usage Instructions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open a terminal window in the same directory as the project folder.
Then, do a
________________
| $ make upload |
|_______________|

and type in
_______________
| $ serial-mon |
|______________|

And watch how much faster getRestaurantFast() is compared to getRestaurant()
