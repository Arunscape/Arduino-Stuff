A very simple program which computes the greatest common denominator of two
positive integers, which the user is prompted to enter.

Usage: open a terminal window in the program folder, and type make. Then run
./exercise7 and the program will prompt you to enter two positive integers.

More clearly, run these commands:

$ cd Exercise7
$ make
$ ./exercise7

Should you want to clean up the build files just run a 
$ make clean
