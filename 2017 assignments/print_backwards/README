Weekly Exercise 4: String Functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We had to create a function on our own that accepts a null terminated character
array, and returns its length. Additionally, another function was made to print
the string backwards to the serial monitor

Accessories:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-1 x Arduino Mega Board



Wiring Instructions:
Plug the Arduino board into your computer


Usage Instructions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open a terminal window in the same directory as the project folder.
Then, do a
________________
| $ make upload |
|_______________|

and type in
_______________
| $ serial-mon |
|______________|

You will see the program do some tests on its own. The excersise4.cpp file can
be edited, or the string_processing.h and string_processing.cpp file can be moved
to a new project directory, where you can call the functions yourself, if you
#include "string_processing.h"
in your program


Acknowledgments:
---------------------------------
Veronica Salm very helpfully pointed out that originally, in my getStringLength
function, the variable character was initially declared empty. After I made its
initial value nonempty, some quirkiness of what was printed to the serial monitor
was removed. e.g. before, if I had exactly 3 lines of Serial.print() calls to
print the values that getStringLength() was returning, the second number returned
would be -1. If any changes such as adding another Serial.print() call was made,
then the error would go away. Ever since I made the initial value of the variable
character nonempty, I could not get this issue to replicate!
