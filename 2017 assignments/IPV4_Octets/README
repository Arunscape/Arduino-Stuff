Purpose:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program accepts input for a 32 bit unsigned integer that represents an ip
address in decimal form. The program will then print the value of each octet in
the ip address you entered. To acheive this functionality, the program uses
bitshifting, and the bitwise AND operation.

Accessories:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-1 x Arduino Mega Board


Wiring Instructions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plug in the arduino to your computer


Usage Instructions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open a terminal window in the same directory as the project folder.
(Assuming you have arduino-ua in your PATH)

Then, do a
________________
| $ make upload |
|_______________|

and type in
_______________
| $ serial-mon |
|______________|

The program will then instruct you to enter an ip address in decimal form.
You can easily test some ip addresses by converting them to decimal form
using this website: https://www.browserling.com/tools/ip-to-dec
And enter the decimal form of the ip address when prompted to do so

Example of how the program works:
The ip address 74.125.224.72 can be broken up into 4 octets:

Octet 3 Octet 2  Octet 1  Octet 0
 74      125      224       72
 |        |        |        |
1001010 01111101 11100000 01001000

If you combine all these bits into one long string of ones and zeros you get:
1001010011111011110000001001000

Which can be read as 1249763400 in the decimal system that we all know and love.

The program will then read each octet and produce output similar to this:
Octet 0: 72
Octet 1: 224
Octet 2: 125
Octet 3: 74

Before asking for input, the program will do some basic tests. The last two tests
are designed to fail, so do not worry about the last two errors that are thrown.
The first 4 tests before it should say "Test passed"

Additional thoughts:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Aside from Atom overwriting this really nice README file that I had to redo...)

I also made a function called AdvancedtestGetOctet() which generates pseudo random
ip addresses. (Pseudo random, because it uses the random() function to help generate
the ip addresses, which is not totally random. However, this function acheives the
purpose of testing the program against a lot of IP addresses) If you would like
to check it out, uncomment line 170.
