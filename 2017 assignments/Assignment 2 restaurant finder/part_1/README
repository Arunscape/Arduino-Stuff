Restaurant Finder Part 1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program is the first part of an assignment that allows a user to browse a
map of Edmonton using a joystick and a dislay on an Arduino, and find
restaurants nearby where the user clicks the joystick.

Accessories:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-1 x Arduino Mega Board
-1 x SainSmart Joystick
-1 x Adafruit ILI9341 display
-1 x 8GB SD Card

**SD card needs to be formatted in a very special way, however we cannot tell you how to
  format it and put the files on it properly because that was done by the TAs and
  we are not given access to the software.


Wiring Instructions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Joystick   Arduino
----------------------------
GND  <-->  GND (board bus)
5V   <-->  5V (board bus)
VRX  <-->  Analog Pin 1
VRY  <-->  Analog Pin 0
SW   <-->  Digital Pin 2


Display               Arduino
------------------------------------
GND        <-->       GND
Vin        <-->       5V
3Vo        <-->       NOT CONNECTED
CLK        <-->       52
MISO       <-->       50
MOSI       <-->       51
CS         <-->       10
D/C        <-->       9

Lite       <-->       NOT CONNECTED
Y+         <-->       A2 (analog pin)
X+         <-->       4  (digital pin)
Y-         <-->       5  (digital pin)
X-         <-->       A3 (analog pin)
IM0 - IM3  <-->       NOT CONNECTED (they expect a 3.3v signal, DON'T CONNECT!)
CCS        <-->       6
CD         <-->       NOT CONNECTED


Usage Instructions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open a terminal window in the same directory as the project folder.
Then, do a

Now, you can use the joystick to move the red cursor on the screen. Click the
joystick to open a menu that will show the top 30 restaurants near the location
where you clicked. Select a restaurant with the joystick to be shown where on the
map the restaurant is. The cursor will be hovering over the restaurant you selected.


Acknowledgments:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this assignment, a lot of code from previous assignments were used, and a lot
of the code used in the previous assignments (Exercise 5, Exercise 6) were worked on in
class. Certain chunks of code were given on eclass, as well. These given chunks of code
are highlighted by comments indicating so.
