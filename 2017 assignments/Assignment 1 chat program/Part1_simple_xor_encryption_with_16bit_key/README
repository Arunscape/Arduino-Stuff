Purpose:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program allows serial communication between Arduinos. The characters are
encrypted using XOR encryption. Two private keys are generated using the least
significant bit from 16 readings from the analogPin. From this, public keys are
generated and exchanged, allowing a shared key to be used for the encryption.

Accessories:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-3 x Breadboard Jumper Wires
-2 x Arduino Mega Board


Wiring Instructions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arduino 1 GND <--> Arduino 2 GND
Arduino 1 TX3 14 <--> Arduino 2 RX3 15
Arduino 1 RX3 15 <--> Arduino 2 TX3 14


Usage Instructions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open a terminal window in the same directory as the project folder.
Then, do a
________________
| $ make upload |
|_______________|

and type in
_______________
| $ serial-mon |
|______________|

You will then have to share your public key with your partner, and your partner
will have to share his/her public key with you.
Both of you have to manually type in your partner's public key when the program
prompts you to do so. Do not share your private or shared keys!

the powMod() function was created in class, and can be found here:

the "skeleton" of the chat() function was also developed in class, which we
modified to add the XOR encryption
