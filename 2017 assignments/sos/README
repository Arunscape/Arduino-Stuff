Accessories:
- 1 x 560 Ohm (Grn Blu Brown) resistor
- 1 x LED
- 1 x Arduino Mega Board (AMG)
- 1 x Potentiometer


Wiring instructions:
--------------------
Arduino Pin 13 <--> Resistor <--> Longer LED lead |LED| Shorter LED lead <---> Arduino GND

Arduino 5V Power <--> Outer pin of Potentiometer |Potentiometer| Other outer pin of potentiometer <--> Arduino GND

Middle pin of potentiometer <--> Arduino Analog In 0

Usage instructions:
--------------------
Upload the code from sos.ino to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE



*****************************************************************
The purpose of this code is to send an SOS signal using Morse code by
flashing an LED with the Arduino, and to
vary the speed at which the LED blinks when sending the message using a
potentiometer. The dotTime is adjusted using the potentiometer.

Commented out pieces of code beginning with Serial.begin or Serial.print were used for debugging purposes and can be re-enabled
for more verbose output in the serial monitor. "DOT " represents a dot, "DASH " represents a dash, and each "X" represents
a length of time, the same as dotTime, for when the LED is off

Additional comments:
Originally, I planned to create a function that has an input argument, which accepts
a string, and the idea was to pass "SOS" as the input argument while calling the
function in the main loop, so that it would check each character in the string,
and send an S or an O based on what letter it was.
This probably would've worked also, but halfway through coding it, I realized that
it would end up taking more lines of code  than just making the sendS() and
sendO() functions and calling them in the main loop.

For something as simple as this, it makes sense to just call the sendS() and sendO()
functions from the main loop, however, if we were sending more letters and words
with morse code, or if we wanted a user to be able to send a string of his/her choosing,
I believe the approach I originally had in mind would be desirable.
